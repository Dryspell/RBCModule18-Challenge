# Module 18 Class 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing **unsupervised machine learning**. In this unit, students will learn about unsupervised learning and how it compares to supervised learning.

In today's class, students will learn how to process and prepare data for unsupervised models. The will then be introduced to the K-means algorithm.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand how unsupervised learning compares to supervised learning
* Prepare and process data for unsupervised learning
* Apply K-means clustering
* Use the elbow curve to determine optimal cluster number
